# TDU-Importer-test
A repo for testing the TDU Importer, contains sample dummy data. 

This repo, when used with the TD Importer, will create a database called `test_db` with two tables called `table1` and `table2`, they will have identical data loaded from `table1.csv`

This is not an exhaustive test, just a simple test to aid in development of the tool and to provide CI testing abilities to verify it is still working.
